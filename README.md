# React 7 Development

# Building
This is the development branch for React 7. As such, it is unlikely that building this version of React will result in a working version.
**BUILD AND DEPLOY AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

#### Prerequisites 
* Java JDK 8 must be installed
* JAVA_HOME path might need to be defined (though it may not be needed on all systems) (google is your friend)

To Build React:

1. Clone this repository to your computer somewhere
2. Use your preferred IDE and import the project as a Gradle project
3. Use your IDE's build feature to build React
